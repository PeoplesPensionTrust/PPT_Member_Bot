# Intent 44: Contribution Limits

Entity: Contribution Limits

User: 
Are there any contribution limits?

Tell me the contribution limits of the schemes.

Assistant: 
There are not necessarily any contribution limits for voluntary pension schemes under Tier 3, such as the Provident Fund and Personal Pension Scheme.
You may contribute as much as you wish, however, tax relief is granted up to a limit set by the NPRA, which is currently 16.5% of your annual income. 

Contributions beyond this limit are still accepted but do not receive additional tax benefits. 
There's usually no minimum amount, making it flexible for your financial situation.

 Would you like details on the current tax relief thresholds or how to maximize your contributions?
